# 2023 Week 5 02/19/2023 - 02/26/2023

## Goals for this week
- Investigate common attacks in MANETs
- Investigate how attackers write this code (start understnading implementation)
    - Reach out to Prof. Atkins?
    - Investigate attacks based on what layer they impact?
- Figure out how to simulate an attacking environement


## 02/26/2023 What did you learn?










First include the whiteboard discussion picture from last meeting, if any. 

![whiteboard discussion](/templates/references/w31/2019_w31_a_whiteboard.jpg)

Then, briefly describe the key points and highlight takeaways we discussed during last
meeting. Frequently, this could include referring to a previous notes, which
should be referenced explicitly [like this](/templates/notes/2019_w31_a.md#intuitions-behind-modeling-forward-and-backward-propagation-separately).


## Optional: What we hear on the grapevine 

This section contains interesting research related questions that you found
through subscribing to mailing list, online group discussions etc. The key idea
is to get a sense about the greater research/tech community really care about
regarding the specific area we are working on. For example, if a student works
on the distributed training topics, he/she could subscribe to TensorFlow online
discussion forum.  


## Research Questions 

This section is the main part that contains your investigations. Each
subsection, e.g., [this one](#how-to-predict-distributed-training-speed),
should be named carefully. The section names should ideally summarize the theme
of the investigation. Your notes should serve as the key building blocks for
writing your first paper draft, getting relevant personnels to what you did. 

List your research questions here. There should be a 1-to-1 mapping between the research questions and a subsection below. The order of these questions should also be the same as the order of subsections below.

 - How do we predict the distributed training speed?
 - How feasible is it to calculate the training speed for a heterogeneous cluseter?

### Predicting distributed training speed

If this is a new investigation, we need to start by: 
- The motivation/rationale of performing this investigation.
- clearly describing the exactly problem we are solving.  
- Clearly articulating the relationships to other investigations. 
- Proposed solutions. 
- Evaluation plans. 
- Evaluation results. 



If this is an continuation of previous week, mention

If this is the last of our investigation on this topic, we should assemble all
the previous investigations from previous notes---by creating backward
references, e.g., [regarding
motivation](2019_w31_a.md#how-to-predict-distributed-training-speed-part-one),
so that we could have all the information mentioned above in one place. This
could be very useful for 


## Discussions 
This section can be used to keep track of threads in which multiple rounds of
comments and revisions were needed. Each discussion should have a name that
represents the key topic of the discussion. 

### Feasibility of calculating heterogeneous cluster training speed
